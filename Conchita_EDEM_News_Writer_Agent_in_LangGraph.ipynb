tech in 2026 - IBM\", \"url\": \"https://www.ibm.com/think/news/ai-tech-trends-predictions-2026\", \"content\": \"2026 will be defined by three trends that move AI beyond personal productivity, says Kevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer at Writer, an enterprise AI platform for agentic work.\\n\\n“First, AI is shifting from individual usage to team and workflow orchestration,” Chung told IBM Think. That means coordinating entire workflows, connecting data across departments and moving projects from idea to completion.\\n\\nSecond, as reasoning capabilities improve, systems won’t just follow instructions: they’ll anticipate needs. “This evolution transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator capable of meaningful problem-solving and decision-making,” he said. [...] 2024 ended on a high note for open-source AI with Meta’s Llama models gaining traction. Since then, the open-source AI ecosystem has grown a lot, with smaller, domain-specific models achieving impressive results—it’s the case for IBM’s Granite, Ai2’s Olmo 3 and, of course, DeepSeek’s models. Anthony Annunziata, Director of Open Source AI at IBM and the AI Alliance, sees this trend accelerating in 2026.\\n\\n“We’re going to see smaller reasoning models that are multimodal and easier to tune for specific domains,” he said during an interview with IBM Think. [...] Advances in fine‑tuning and reinforcement learning also mean that enterprises can adopt open-source AI, feeding the appetite for smaller and efficient models. “Instead of one giant model for everything, you’ll have smaller, more efficient models that are just as accurate—maybe more so—when tuned for the right use case,” he said.\\n\\nOpen source, agentic AI will accelerate this trend. “General‑purpose agents aren’t enough for legal, health or manufacturing,” Annunziata said. “You need domain‑enriched models and architectures that reflect expert workflows.”\", \"score\": 0.9992848}, {\"title\": \"Five Trends in AI and Data Science for 2026\", \"url\": \"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-trends-in-ai-and-data-science-for-2026/\", \"content\": \"Last year, like virtually everyone else, we predicted that agentic AI would be on the rise. Although we acknowledged that the technology was being hyped and had some challenges, we underestimated the degree of both. Agents turned out to be the most-hyped trend since, well, generative AI. GenAI now resides in the Gartner trough of disillusionment, which we predict agents will fall into in 2026.

GenAI now resides in the Gartner trough of disillusionment, which we predict agents will fall into in 2026. [...] Carolyn Geason-Beissel/MIT SMR | Getty Images\\n\\nMIT SMR columnists Thomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean see five AI trends to pay attention to in 2026: deflation of the AI bubble and subsequent hits to the economy; growth of the “factory” infrastructure for all-in AI adapters; greater focus on generative AI as an organizational resource rather than an individual one; continued progression toward value from agentic AI, despite the hype; and ongoing questions around who should manage data and AI.\", \"score\": 0.9992084}, {\"title\": \"What's next in AI: 7 trends to watch in 2026 - Microsoft Source\", \"url\": \"https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/whats-next-in-ai-7-trends-to-watch-in-2026/\", \"content\": \"What’s different now is the rise of hybrid computing, where quantum works alongside AI and supercomputers. AI finds patterns in data. Supercomputers run massive simulations. And quantum adds a new layer that will drive far greater accuracy for modeling molecules and materials, he says. This progress coincides with advances in logical qubits, which are physical quantum bits grouped together so they can detect and correct errors and compute — a critical step toward reliability. [...] This transformation is visible everywhere. In medicine, AI is helping close gaps in care. In software development, it’s learning not just code but the context behind it. In scientific research, it’s becoming a true lab assistant. In quantum computing, new hybrid approaches are heralding breakthroughs once thought impossible.\\n\\nAs AI agents become digital colleagues and take on specific tasks at human direction, organizations are strengthening security to keep pace with new risks. The infrastructure powering these advances is also maturing, with smarter, more efficient systems.\\n\\nThese seven trends to watch in 2026 show what’s possible when people join forces with AI.\\n\\n## AI will amplify what people can achieve together [...] Software development is exploding, with activity on GitHub reaching new levels in 2025. Each month, developers merged 43 million pull requests — a 23% increase from the prior year in one of the main ways teams propose and review changes to their code. The annual number of commits pushed, which track those changes, jumped 25% year-over-year to 1 billion. The unprecedented pace signals a major shift in the industry as AI becomes increasingly central to how software is built and improved.\\n\\nMario Rodriguez, GitHub’s chief product officer, says that sheer volume is why 2026 will bring a new edge: “repository intelligence.” In plain terms, it means AI that understands not just lines of code but the relationships and history behind them.\", \"score\": 0.9989759}, {\"title\": \"10 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2026 | TechTarget\", \"url\": \"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends\", \"content\": \"In 2024, researchers at Simon Fraser University developed a comprehensive Machine Intelligence Quotient (MIQ) framework intended to assess the intelligence of autonomous vehicles. In 2026, the MIQ will emerge as a standard comparison benchmark for AI systems. MIQ embraces a composite scoring system that exceeds traditional performance measures to include metrics such as reasoning ability, accuracy, efficiency, explainability, adaptability, speed and ethical compliance compounded into a unified comprehensive score. As AI systems adopt MIQ standardization, it will be possible to rate and compare AI systems built in-house as well as those provided by competing AI providers. [...] ## 9. AI reshapes the workplace\\n\\nAI systems have proven they can enhance business workflows, and this trend will accelerate in 2026 and beyond. AI management platforms are using predictive analytics and automation to autonomously redesign and optimize workflows, HR systems can oversee employee performance and effectiveness, and an array of other AI systems can enhance scheduling, communication, collaboration, data collection and processing, among other everyday business tasks.\\n\\nWhen implemented and managed properly, AI systems can free employees from mundane and traditionally error-prone tasks, allowing them to focus on more important business needs. [...] ## 10. Businesses set to embrace 'invisible AI'\\n\\nGenAI is empowering businesses of all sizes to create text, music, speech, video and 3D assets with little more than a prompt. GenAI content creation will become even faster and more dynamic, enabling users to create highly personalized content on demand. A McKinsey and Company report suggested that GenAI will be capable of average human performance by the end of this decade. In addition, AI-generated content will increasingly include synthetic data created for software development and testing, network security testing, medical research and other fields.\", \"score\":

The latest trends reveal a significant shift from AI as a standalone tool to an integrated, collaborative, and highly specialized entity. This evolution is redefining how we work, innovate, and interact with technology, moving towards a future where AI is not just intelligent but also adaptive and seamlessly woven into the fabric of our operations.\n","\n","One of the most prominent shifts is AI's transition from individual productivity enhancement to comprehensive workflow orchestration. AI systems are increasingly designed to coordinate entire workflows, connect disparate data across departments, and manage projects from conception to completion. This move transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator, capable of anticipating needs, engaging in complex problem-solving, and contributing to decision-making processes. It signifies a maturation where AI doesn't just follow instructions but actively contributes to strategic outcomes.\n","\n","Parallel to this, the open-source AI ecosystem is experiencing explosive growth. Smaller, more efficient, multimodal, and domain-specific models are gaining significant traction. Projects like IBM's Granite, Ai2's Olmo 3, and DeepSeek's models exemplify this trend, offering flexible solutions that are easier to fine-tune for particular use cases. This democratization of AI technology empowers organizations to leverage advanced capabilities without proprietary constraints. Furthermore, agentic AI, despite some initial hype, is progressing towards delivering tangible value. The focus is now on developing domain-enriched models and architectures tailored for expert workflows in critical sectors such as legal, healthcare, and manufacturing, ensuring AI solutions are precisely aligned with industry-specific needs.\n","\n","AI's broader impact is also evident in its integration across various sectors. Generative AI is moving beyond individual creative tasks to become a vital organizational resource, enabling faster, more dynamic content creation, including highly personalized material and synthetic data for diverse applications. In scientific research, hybrid computing approaches, where quantum computing works in tandem with AI and supercomputers, are heralding breakthroughs once thought impossible, enhancing accuracy in complex modeling. The workplace itself is being reshaped, with AI optimizing HR systems, scheduling, communication, and data processing, freeing human employees from mundane tasks to focus on higher-value activities. This pervasive integration is leading to the rise of \"invisible AI,\" where artificial intelligence operates seamlessly in the background, enhancing efficiency without overt user interaction.\n","\n","As AI capabilities expand, the need for standardized measurement becomes crucial. The Machine Intelligence Quotient (MIQ) is emerging as a comprehensive framework to assess AI intelligence. This benchmark evaluates a broad spectrum of metrics, including reasoning ability, accuracy, efficiency, explainability, adaptability, speed, and ethical compliance. The adoption of MIQ will allow for more objective comparisons and evaluations of AI systems, fostering greater transparency and reliability.\n","\n","While the future of AI is undeniably exciting, it also presents challenges. Predictions suggest a potential \"deflation of the AI bubble,\" prompting a more realistic assessment of its economic impact and capabilities. Ethical considerations and robust security measures are paramount as AI agents become digital colleagues, necessitating ongoing discussions about data governance and AI management. Nevertheless, the unprecedented pace of innovation, particularly in areas like software development with \"repository intelligence\" – AI understanding not just code but its context and history – underscores AI's enduring potential to amplify human achievement.\n","\n","In conclusion, the latest trends paint a picture of an AI that is increasingly collaborative, specialized, integrated, and measurable. From orchestrating complex workflows to driving scientific breakthroughs and reshaping the workplace, AI's transformative potential continues to grow. As these trends mature, artificial intelligence will become an even more indispensable partner in driving progress across every facet of our world.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"nGiB017CIqW8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
